# Rock Paper Scissors

A project from The Odin Project to practice Javascript basics, problem solving, and DOM manipulation.
Specifically it was meant to expose what Javascript can do such as what the available in-built functions are, how to tackle a problem from scratch, and how to manipulate the DOM in ways such as references HTML elements, manipulating their text, and attaching events to buttons.
